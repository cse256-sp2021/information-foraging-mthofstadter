    <h2>
      At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that every child is
      a unique individual with his or her own pattern and timetable for
      social, emotional, intellectual and physical growth.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We believe in learning through play; we provide fun, child-centered
      activities that effectively engage students. We encourage creativity in
      all areas with a special focus on the arts to enhance language and
      thinking. Above all, our goals are that children will develop a genuine
      pleasure in learning, that they develop confidence in their ability to
      learn and to accomplish challenging tasks and that they gain experience
      and skills in interacting with others.
