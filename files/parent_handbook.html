      <h3>Parent-Staff Communication</h3>
      <p>Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
        give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
        emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
        concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
        or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.		</p>
      <h3>Parent-Teacher	Conferences</h3>
      <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
        conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	
        keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
        development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
        writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
        in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	
      </p>
      <div id="discipline"></div>
      <p>
      Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
      students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
      group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
      informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
      and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
      Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
      curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
      child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
      read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.

      <h3>Discipline</h3>
      <div id="orientation"></div>
      <p>
      The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
      appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
      stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
      the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
      their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
      more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
      lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer. This is done through:
      Positive	reinforcement, Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction, Re-direction: guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,
      socially	positive	activities, Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings, Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	
      respectful	and	constructive	manner, Simple and logical	immediate	consequences.
      </p>
      <h3>Transition to School &amp; Orientation</h3>
      <p>This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
        opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
        hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
        overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.
        The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
        orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
        Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
        before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.</p>
      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <p>The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.</p>

      <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
      <p>Values	children	for	their	wonder	and	curiosity,	their	ideas	and	creativity,	and	their delight	in	play.
      Values	families	for	their	traditions	and	goals,	their	commitment	to	home,	work,	play,	community,
        and	their	dreams	for	their	children.
      </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>The	Washington	University	Nursery	School	was	founded	in	1947	as	a	cooperative	venture	of	
        faculty	and	Washington	University	in	St.	Louis.	The	primary	purpose	of	the	nursery	school	is	
        to	provide	the	highest	quality	preschool	program	for	children	2	years	and	7	months	to	5	
        years	of	age.	Today	about	70	percent	of	the	children	are	from	families	of	Washington	
        University	in	St.	Louis	faculty,	staff	and	students, and	the	remaining	are	from	families	in	the	
        community.
